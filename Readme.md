CarBrands Project, is a sample Project to demonstrate VIPER architecture in SWIFT. In this project I have used Appleâ€™s Native combine framework for object bindings.

This application lists various Automobile manufacturers and their models in the details section. Used custom Network wrapper, reusable UI components and Dependency injection.

Used XCUniit and XCUItest cases for code coverage.
