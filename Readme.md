CarBrands Project, is a sample Project to demonstrate VIPER architecture in SWIFT. In this project I have used Appleâ€™s Native combine framework for object bindings.

This Project consists of own Network wrapper and reusable UI components and dependancy approach for module Initialization.

Used XCUniit and XCUItest cases.
